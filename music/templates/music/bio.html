		When it comes it comes to DJing there are essentially 3 important principals every DJ should have strengths in:</p>
                <li>A broad familiarity and continuing exploration of various types of music - and the music collection to back it up.
                <li>The skills to work with your equipment, technology and abilities to make it all work together seamlessly.
                <li>The ability to read the crowd and really connect with people, so you're consistently making the right choices in what you play.
